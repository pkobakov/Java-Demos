# Java-Demos
This repo is for demonstration purposes only. I've created it to practice my migration from C# and Javascript to Java. 
And to share my first experience with Intellij IDEA. It contains examples for:

- DataTypes
- IF ELSE conditionals
- While, Switch and For loops
- Usage of static and final keywords
- OOP,  Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance
- Data structures
- Collections
- Lambda and Streams
- Input and Output, Working with files
- Functional interfaces
- Threads and Multithreading
